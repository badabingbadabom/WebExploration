# WebExploration
A Firefox Addon that changes the display of the newtab page. The Addon alters the default new-tab page of the web browser by displaying website recommendations under different schemes, namely the most visited sites, the least visited sites, the default high frecency based sites and a blank UI with no websites. We convenience sampled around 100 participants and asked them to use our web-extension for two months. Based on detailed analysis of the browsing logs collected from those participants, we observed that the passive website recommendations embedded in the new tab displays of browsers (that recommend based on frecency) inhibit peoples' propensity to visit diverse information sources on the internet.
